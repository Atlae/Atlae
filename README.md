### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Atlae/Atlae** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on assignments in Java and writing a Discord bot in Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP to interact with Tapatalk's API.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Java or Python project.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding positions at a lab or an internship.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, really!
- 📫 How to reach me: Reach out to me on Discord at @Atlae#0779!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him preferred, although they/them will work as well
- ⚡ Fun fact: I study at UC San Diego majoring in Biology with a Specialization in Bioinformatics. 🔱Shock 'em Tritons!🔱⚡
- 🌐 Many of my published repositories relate to the online political simulator [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net) [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NationStates) and one of its largest communities, [The East Pacific](https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific). These were my first forays into coding and trying new things, and hopefully you'll see new projects published soon!
